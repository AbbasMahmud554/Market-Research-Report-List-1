<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Moulding Maize Starch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rapidly Digestible Starch</li><li>Slowly Digestible Starch</li><li>Resistant Starch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The moulding maize starch market consists of three key types: rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch, and resistant starch. Rapidly digestible starch is quickly broken down and absorbed, providing immediate energy. Slowly digestible starch is digested at a slower rate, offering prolonged energy release and better blood sugar control. Resistant starch, on the other hand, resists digestion in the small intestine and acts as a dietary fiber, promoting gut health and satiety. Each type serves distinct dietary and functionality needs in food applications.</p></p>
