<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral Mucositis Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemotherapy</li><li>Radiotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oral mucositis therapeutics market is primarily divided into two segments based on treatment types: chemotherapy-induced and radiotherapy-induced. Chemotherapy-derived oral mucositis occurs due to the toxic effects of anticancer agents, leading to inflammation and ulceration in the oral cavity. In contrast, radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis arises from radiation exposure to head and neck regions, causing similar mucosal damage. Both segments require targeted therapies to manage pain, promote healing, and alleviate symptoms, thus highlighting the need for effective treatment solutions in oncology care.</p></p>
