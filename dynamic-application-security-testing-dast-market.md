<p><p>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing methodology that evaluates applications while they are running. Unlike static application security testing, which examines source code, DAST identifies vulnerabilities by interacting with the application in real-time, simulating external attacks like those from malicious users. This approach helps organizations uncover security flaws that could potentially be exploited.</p><p>The DAST market is experiencing significant growth driven by the increasing number of cyber threats and the rising importance of application security in the software development lifecycle. Organizations are integrating DAST tools into their DevOps processes to enhance security without compromising speed. The surge in cloud-based applications and the adoption of agile methodologies are also contributing to the rising demand for DAST solutions.</p><p>The Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% during the forecast period. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, are being incorporated into DAST tools to improve threat detection capabilities. Furthermore, there is a growing emphasis on compliance with regulatory standards, further driving investment in DAST solutions as companies seek to ensure robust security measures in their application ecosystems.</p></p>
