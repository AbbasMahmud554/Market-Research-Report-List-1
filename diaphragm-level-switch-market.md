<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Level Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Differential Pressure Switch</li><li>Static Pressure Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diaphragm level switch market includes two primary types: differential pressure switches and static pressure switches. Differential pressure switches detect changes in pressure between two points, allowing them to determine liquid levels by measuring the pressure difference across a diaphragm. In contrast, static pressure switches measure the absolute pressure at a single point, providing direct readings of fluid levels based on the weight of the liquid column above the switch. Both types are crucial for precise liquid level monitoring in various industrial applications.</p></p>
